                <p>In this new paragraph, I would like to quote the actor Al Pacino, who said: <q>YOU CAN’T LET YOUR SKIN GET TOO THICK.</q></p><!--Block Quotes begin-->
                <p>This is another paragraph. Further, Al Pacino said: <blockquote cite="https://the-talks.com/interview/al-pacino/">I don’t know. You don’t think of it that way. You don’t think of those parts as achievements. You think of the roles you play, the paintings you’ve made.</p>
                	<p>I mean, imagine an actor saying, “I don’t want to go on anymore because I can’t do better than the last movie I made. I might as well quit now.” We’d call that resting on your laurels and I guess you’re not supposed to do that. I’m all for that! You know, resting on your laurels, you get a nice big check, take another profession on… But for some thick reason, I keep wanting to go back and do this stuff.</blockquote></p><!--Block Quotes end.-->
